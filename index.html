          “As a fellow massage therapist with chronic neck and shoulder tension, finding someone I trust was crucial. That's where Laurie shines! Her sessions are more than just massages; they are healing experiences. Her space is always pristine, welcoming, and a testament to her dedication..Laurie's expertise, especially in trigger point therapy, has been a game-changer for me. She combines her skill with genuine enthusiasm and a warm smile, making each visit a deeply healing experience. “It takes pain to get rid of pain,” she says, and she's right—every session with her brings lasting relief.
            I always look forward to my time with Laurie and recommend her without hesitation. She's not just a massage therapist; she's a true healer who cares deeply about her clients' well-being.”
